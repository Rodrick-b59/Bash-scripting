# expressions are categorized into 3 types and based on the expression, we need to use  operators   

# 1. numbers
# 2. strings
# 3. files

# operators on numbers
# 1. -eq  (equal)
# 2. -ne  (not equal)
# 3. -gt  (greater than)
# 4. -lt  (less than)
# 5. -ge  (greater than or equal to)
# 6. -le  (less than or equal to)

# operators on strings
# 1. =  (equal) eg. a=10  (meaning a is equal to 10)
# 2. !=  (not equal)  eg a!=10  (meanins a not equal to 10)
# 
# 3. -z  (zero length)
# 4. -n  (non zero length)  # -n is used to check the length of the string

# operators on files
# 1. -f  (file exists)
# 2. -d  (directory exists)
# 3. -s  (file is not empty)
# 4. -r  (file has read permission)
